# Rowan Zombie Survival was a project for my upper level elective, intro to Virtual Reality. The code is hosted here. Due to size limits, the 3D assets are not on github. Feel free to email me for them
 This projects requires WorldViz Vizard VR to run. http://www.worldviz.com/vizard-virtual-reality-software

******************************************************* 


May  2004: Electrical and Computer Engineering Students work on a new
           bio-algorithm to create zombies for the Biology Department.

July 2004: The Biology Department finds a major bug in the algorithm, and
           expects them to all die off, so he hides them under the Engineering
           Building.

Feb  2014: The Zombies are still alive. Due to the Engineering Building sinking
           6 inches, the Zombies are extremely uncomfortable and ESCAPE.


Instructions: Fight off the zombies to get to the roof of the Engineering
              Building. From there, you will zipline to the Science Building
              where the Biology Department can give you a cure.
              Make sure to grab objects along the way, so you can increase your
              power and toughness

GOOD LUCK. No pressure, just all of our lives depend on you
